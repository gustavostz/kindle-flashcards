<h1>Flashcards in the ANKI Cloze Format to Import</h1>
<h2>Format Definition</h2>
<p>The format will be a TSV (Tab-Separated Values) file consisting of the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cloze-context</code>: The context in which the word was used, with the key term replaced by a cloze deletion. The term to be tested (the stem) is enclosed in double curly braces with a cloze identifier (e.g., <code>{{c1::stem}}</code>). This format allows for the creation of fill-in-the-blank style flashcards.</li>
<li><code>stem</code>: The base form (stem) of the word that was retrieved from the <code>vocab.db</code>.</li>
<li><code>flashcard-explanation</code>: The explanation or description that relates to the word in the context, intended for the flashcard content.</li>
</ul>
<p>The columns are separated by a tab character (<code>\t</code>) and the rows are separated by a new line character (<code>\n</code>). The file should be saved with the <code>.tsv</code> extension.</p>
<h3>Format Example</h3>
<pre><code class="language-tsv">{cloze-context}	{stem}	{flashcard-explanation}
</code></pre>
<h3>Example with Data</h3>
<pre><code class="language-tsv">Either one is {{c1::tantalizing}}, but together they are enough to drive you to madness. 	tantalizing	Explanation1
They came through {{c1::sewers}}, wading through the filth and muck, heartbeats erratic and fearful. 	sewers	Explanation two
Through the barred window in my cell door, I watched them {{c1::skulk}} down the brick-lined hallway with great caution. 	skulk	Explanation 3
</code></pre>
<p>This format is specifically designed for the ANKI Cloze format, facilitating the creation of cloze deletion cards where the learner is prompted to recall the missing information (the stem) within a given context. The <code>cloze-context</code> provides the sentence or phrase with the missing word, promoting active recall and engagement with the content.</p>
