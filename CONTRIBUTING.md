# Contribution Guidelines 📝

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines to maintain a well-organized and user-friendly repository:

- **🏷️ Categorization and ReadMe Update:** Suggested Instructions, DeckTemplates, or Guidelines should be properly categorized in the ReadMe. If the category does not exist, create a new one. This ensures that your valuable input is easily discoverable and reusable by the community.
- **🆔 Naming Convention:** The suggestions **must** follow the pattern `{ID}-{Name-spaced-by-hyphen}`. Use a sequential 4-digit number for the ID. The Name must start with a capital letter and be spaced by a hyphen.
- **💼 Separate Pull Requests:** Make an individual pull request for each suggestion to streamline the review process.
- **✍️ Spelling and Grammar:** Check your spelling and grammar.
- **🚫 Whitespace:** Configure your text editor to remove trailing whitespace.
