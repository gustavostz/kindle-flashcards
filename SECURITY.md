# Security Policy

## Project in Beta

**Notice:** This project is currently in its beta phase. We are actively refining the integration with ChatGPT, especially in processing large volumes of flashcards. It is important to be aware that inaccuracies may occur during the generation of flashcards via ChatGPT. However, rest assured that once data is added to our temporary storage, it remains secure until the designated cleaning process occurs.

## Data Policy Information

Your flashcards are stored temporarily. Please note that if someone obtains the name of your download link, they could potentially access and download your flashcards. This access persists until the temporary storage is cleared.

We do not assume responsibility for the deletion or unauthorized access of your flashcards. Users are advised against storing sensitive information within our services, as we cannot be held liable for any loss or exposure of such data.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Should you discover a potential security vulnerability, we urge you to report it promptly. Please send an email to kindle-flashcards@gustavostz.com with the subject line `[Vulnerability]` and also create an issue on our platform. Although our system does not typically handle sensitive data, we take the security of all data very seriously. Your diligence in reporting any concerns is highly appreciated and contributes significantly to the overall integrity of our services.
