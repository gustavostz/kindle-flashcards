<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to Kindle Flashcards. This Privacy Policy outlines our commitments and your rights regarding the handling and protection of your data during your use of our services. Kindle Flashcards is an open-source project aimed at enhancing your learning experience by integrating Kindle vocabulary with GPT-4 to generate Anki flashcards. While our service primarily processes data transiently, we have introduced a temporary storage feature to improve the functionality of our services.</p>
<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

This storage is transient and is designed to facilitate the generation of flashcards.</li>
<li>Users are strongly advised not to input or upload any sensitive personal information into the system, as the temporary storage is not intended for long-term data retention.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
<ul>

<li>Users should be mindful of the temporary nature of the storage and are advised to download their flashcards promptly after generation.</li>
</ul>
