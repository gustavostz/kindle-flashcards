# Kindle Flashcards Privacy Policy
Last Updated: January 30, 2024

## Introduction
Welcome to Kindle Flashcards. This Privacy Policy outlines our commitments and your rights regarding the handling and protection of your data during your use of our services. Kindle Flashcards is an open-source project aimed at enhancing your learning experience by integrating Kindle vocabulary with GPT-4 to generate Anki flashcards. While our service primarily processes data transiently, we have introduced a temporary storage feature to improve the functionality of our services.

## Information Collection and Use
- Kindle Flashcards processes and temporarily stores data necessary for service provision, such as vocabulary words and context from the `vocab.db` file and generated flashcards, in a temporary storage. This storage is transient and is designed to facilitate the generation of flashcards.
- Users are strongly advised not to input or upload any sensitive personal information into the system, as the temporary storage is not intended for long-term data retention.
- User commands and interactions with our service are used solely for the purpose of generating the requested flashcards and improving the quality of our service.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure
- Kindle Flashcards does not share, disclose, or transfer any information to third parties, except for the temporary storage of data necessary for the generation of flashcards.
- Users should be aware that any data uploaded to the temporary storage is accessible through the download link by **any** user until the temporary storage is cleared.

## Data Retention and Deletion
- Data in the temporary storage is retained only for a short period to facilitate the generation and retrieval of flashcards and is automatically cleared after this period.
- Users should be mindful of the temporary nature of the storage and are advised to download their flashcards promptly after generation.

## Changes to Our Privacy Policy
- Kindle Flashcards reserves the right to modify this privacy policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on our official website (https://kindle-flashcards.gustavostz.com) with an updated revision date.
